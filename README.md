# Welcome to Ubuntu Freedom
Ubuntu Freedom is a platform for those who love Ubuntu. So much that the philosophy encourages them to opine outside the networks. Well here is the perfect network.

# Mirror?
Yes, mirror. A way to download Ubuntu in the simplest way in the universe. Ubuntu Freedom is self-updating to offer warranty to those who download from here (UBUNTU DOES NOT BRING ANY WARRANTY) is a guarantee of help, NOT HARDWARE.

# How to solve a problem or a doubt?
Issues is a way to solve doubts, failures, problems and much more.
